    "# Machine Learning Models and Predicting Public Sector Electricity Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to predict the Primary average energy price for each State in the residential sector for the year 2021 based on residential sector features. And to do so using a variety of Machine Learning Models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data information\n",
    "EIA's State Energy Data System (SEDS) is a comprehensive data set that consists of annual time series estimates of State-level energy use by major economic sectors, energy production and State-level energy price and expenditure data.[6]\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is organized by State, Year, and MSN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MSNs are five-character codes, most of which are structured as follows:\n",
    "First and second characters - describes an energy source (for example, NG for natural gas, MG for motor gasoline)\n",
    "Third and fourth characters - describes an energy sector or an energy activity (for example, RC for residential consumption, PR for production)\n",
    "Fifth character - describes a type of data (for example, P for data in physical unit, B for data in billion Btu and D is for dollars per million BTU)[6]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Models\n",
    "\n",
    "A *regression* attempts to fit a function to observed data to make predictions on new data. A *linear regression* fits a straight line to observed data, attempting to demonstrate a linear relationship between variables and make predictions on new data yet to be observed[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "So given a set of predictors, all combined, with an error term yields a linear relationship to some response. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is $ y_i = \\beta_0+ \\beta_{i1}.... + \\epsilon_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic goal of Support Vector Regression is to find a function $f(x)$ that has at most $\\epsilon$ from actually obtained targets $y_i$ for all of the training data and at the same time is as flat as possible. [2] \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this we must estimate $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ H(\\beta,\\beta_0) = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N} V(y_i - f(x_i)) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\|\\beta\\|^{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors smaller than size $\\epsilon$ are ignored due to having small residual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_H (r) =\\begin{cases} 0 \\text{    if    } \\|r\\| < \\epsilon  \\\\\n",
    "\t\t\\|r\\| - \\epsilon ~ otherwise\n",
    "\\end{cases}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a non parametric supervised learning method, input consisting of k closest training examples in a data set.The output is the average value of k nearest neighbors. [3]\\\n",
    "$f(x) = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{i\\epsilon N_k(`x)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The Neural Network model used was a Multi-Layer Perceptron regressor. It optimizes the squared error using LBFGS or stochastic gradient descent [4]\n",
    "\n",
    "It has the function: $f(\\cdot): R^{m} \\to R^{o} $\n",
    "\n",
    "m = input dimensions \\\n",
    "o = output dimensions \n",
    "\n",
    "A basic model consists of an input layer,hidden layers which transform the values, and an output layer. [6] \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "Uses a linear model, that minimizes loss by updating the model with a lower learning rate as it proceeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Loading cleaning and initial analysis\n",
    "All of the data was first loaded, inspected and cleaned. \n",
    "When loaded the file contains several columns: \\\n",
    "`Data_Status` - A code \\\n",
    "`MSN` - A 5 letter combination to signify energy source, sector and unit of data.\\\n",
    "Units for each category are given below.\\\n",
    "Please see :https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/CDF/Codes_and_Descriptions.xlsx for a full description of each category. \n",

    "\n",
    "The portion of the data that was used was specifically associated with the residential sector. \n",
    "When visualized, most of the data did not fit a distribution that would be considered normal. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlations \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were computed. And variables most strongly associated with the dependent variable were retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$ p_{x,y} = \\rho (X,Y)= \\frac{cov((X,Y))}{\\sigma_{(X)} \\sigma_{(Y)}} $\n",

    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The categorical data, (Years and States) was masked using label encoding.The numerical data was transformed before analysis. Scikit-learn preprocessing was utilized in the form of the StandardScaler class. Which removed the mean and scaled the data to unit variance [7].\n",
    "Please refer to :https://github.com/oohtmeel1/Machine-Learning-_-Prediction_Electricity_Data/blob/main/working_notebooks/Pipeline_work_B.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model training and testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model performed regression on a subset of the data, casting a prediction for the electrical expenditure amount for the year 2021 for each State.\n",
    "The results were then compared by graphing them against the true values as well as computing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Explained Variance (EV) and the $R^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the models performed very well after optimization.\\\n",
    "For all of the models, the true values were plotted on a bar graph, and the predictions were plotted as a scatterplot to help illustrate.\n",
